# Space Race

Space Race is a live-action multiplayer game, supporting multiple users and rooms.  Build using technologies such as Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Pug, Space Race is a game where 2-4 players race their ships to the moon.

Space Race utilizes web sockets for realtime communication between players within rooms. All players are namespaced to a specific room, and players can join a room if it is not full or if the game has not begun.
